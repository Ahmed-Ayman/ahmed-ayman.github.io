This is a summary of the [udacity's OS course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud923), I will
be trying to give you a good overview of what this course is talking about.

The instructor [Ada Gavrilovska](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~ada/) uses a lot of visual metaphors. 
so, you will see me adding a lot of pics to illustrate the concepts.


## 1.1 prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should be familiar with C programming and Linux CMD since you will be doing projects 
related to threading with C.

## 2.1 Books 
- Modern Operating systems
- Operating System Concepts (The dinasurs book)
- Operating systems: three easy pieces.


## 3.1 What is an OS?

It's a piece of software that abstracts (simplifies) and arbitrates (control) the hardware of the computer system.
