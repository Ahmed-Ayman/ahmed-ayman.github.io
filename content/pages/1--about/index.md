Hi there. I'm Ahmed Ayman  and this is my personal blog.
I'm a software developer. I mainly use Drupal and symfony to build sites.
Here at my blog you will see me writing stuff about drupal, symfony, open source and software engineering in general.

Other than the work, I'm an amateur triathlete and an avid-traveller.

Feel free to contact me [ahmedayman055g@gmail.com](mailto:ahmedayman055g@gmail.com)
