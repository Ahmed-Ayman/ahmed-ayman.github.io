I've started working with drupal 8 around 2 years ago, and I can tell it was so painful at first.
so many weird jargon, so many new things.

but thankfully after a while now, I quite understand a lot of stuff about drupal and was very much into contributing
back to it's community. and here I am maintaining a contrib module on drupal.org

The modules is mainly for having a functionality like "people visited your profile" or "people visited this article".

It uses Drupal entities to be as generic as possible, it works fine with the users, content types or any sort of entity
like the taxonomy terms too.


upcoming features for the module:

- [ ] notify the users when someone visits them.
- [ ] create an aggreagate view.
